## Introduction 

VacanSeat is designed to connect venues (restaurants/bars/cafes) that have immediate capacity with patrons for impromptu bookings.

Walking door to door with a group of people or calling venues found using simple search methods on a smartphone, requires a lot of effort and produces arbitrary results.  With VacantSeat users are presented with a range of available options within their direct vicinity that they can filter based upon meaningful requirements such as distance, venue type and most important of all party size.

Merchants are supplied with a new sales channel, useful whether the restaurant is unexpectedly empty or when they simply wish to maximise occupancy.  The signup is simple and the system itself is designed to easily integrate with their existing booking management system.
