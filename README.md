## 1. Introduction
--- 

VACANSEAT is designed to connect venues (restaurants/bars/cafes) that have immediate capacity with patrons for impromptu bookings.

Walking door to door with a group of people or calling venues found using simple search methods on a smartphone, requires a lot of effort and produces arbitrary results.  With VACANSEAT users are presented with a range of available options within their direct vicinity that they can filter based upon meaningful requirements such as distance, venue type and most important of all party size.

Merchants are supplied with a new sales channel, useful whether the restaurant is unexpectedly empty or when they simply wish to maximise occupancy.  The signup is simple and the system itself is designed to easily integrate with their existing booking management system.


## 2. Technology / Framework
---

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="assets/readMe/vacanseat_tech_stack.png" width= "400"></p><br>


The application uses a variety of technologies described below with relevant links.

### *Front End*

The front end application was developed using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) Language and the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework.<br>

### *Back end*

[Amazon Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-flutter-app-amplify/) was used to provide a serverless backend via [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). Using Amplify meant that other AWS features could be accessed such as [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for photo storage and [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for user signup and login. [Websockets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html) is used to send & receive real time data to-from the database.

### *API*


The application utilises the [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps) to show the map with current location and routes to distanation. Also, the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) is integrated for payments from customers to merchants via Stripe Connect.

‚ö†Ô∏è Currently Stripe Connect account is in test mode, so the real transaction will not happen through Vacanseat.
